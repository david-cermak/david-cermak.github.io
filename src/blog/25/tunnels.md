*Console, tunnels, *and... hashtag#ESP32🛜

SSH into a *border router, *create a TCP tunnel, SSH again through that tunnel into an *end device, *do your housekeeping, and disconnect.

*Boring? *Now imagine both the *border router *and the *end device *are *microcontrollers running FreeRTOS.*

*Still boring?*
If not join me this Friday at ArtBar in Brno, where I’ll talk about advanced networking on ESP-IDF, remote/secure console access, tunneling, and bridging packets across network interfaces 👉 https://www.linkedin.com/events/espcommunitymeetup20257374437511319965696/
