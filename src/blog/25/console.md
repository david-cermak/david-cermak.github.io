*Console Apps *on Embedded Systems:
From Serial to Secure Network Consoles via Link-time Registration and Tunneling.

Last month I gave a talk about console applications at the hashtag#ESP32 Community Meeting 👉https://www.linkedin.com/events/espcommunitymeetup20257374437511319965696/, and I’d like to share the slides.

The presentation covers:
* A serial console framework with ready‑to‑use commands 
* Link‑time command registration: a plugin-like approach to composing console apps
* A network console built using libssh
* A tunneling demo: creating a tunnel through one ESP32 (gateway) to another ESP32 (sensor)

If you’re working with ESP32 or embedded systems and care about tooling, remote access, or debugging, this might be interesting.
