🚀 Happy to share that I’ll be speaking at hashtag#LinuxDays 2025 in Prague on October 5!
Topic: *Practical intro into fuzz-testing*

The session covers fuzzing approaches (black/grey/white-box) and tools, how to define fuzz targets and run them on host. We’ll also look at crash reproduction and CI integration.
