*TNFL: *A silent threat to secure boot🔒🥾

Most embedded engineers overlook the *HNDL *risk, and I get it. Much of the data our IoT devices handle lose value after 10+ years. But what about our firmware *trust anchors? *Are the public keys burned into our eFuses ready for the quantum era? Could a future adversary forge a valid firmware signature?

* *TNFL: *Trust Now, Forge Later
* *HNDL: *Harvest Now, Decrypt Later

I gave a short talk this weekend at the hashtag#OpenAlt Conference about the challenges of PQC (post-quantum cryptography) for embedded systems, and recompiled it into a short visual so it reads naturally👇
