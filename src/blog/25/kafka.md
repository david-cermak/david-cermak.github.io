🚀 hashtag#Kafka on hashtag#ESP32? Sounds *kafkaesque... *but it works!

I just got *librdkafka *running on *ESP-IDF *→ an ESP32 producing messages straight into a Kafka cluster. 👉 https://lnkd.in/eH3yxGDr

Why? To see if tiny hashtag#IoT devices can plug into enterprise-grade *data streams.*
And since ESP32 can also host an *MQTT broker, *it could bridge MQTT ↔ Kafka at the edge.

💬 What do you think?
* Overkill for *IoT?*
* Or the next step in bringing *edge data *into *real-time pipelines?*
