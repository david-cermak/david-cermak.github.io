#LinuxDays, a great weekend full of inspiration, talks, and discussions!

This year I was happy to *humbly contribute *with a short presentation on hashtag#Fuzzing:

Big thanks to the organizers and everyone there!

PS: Unfortunately, my demo didn't go as planned🤦‍♂️. *Usually, it's the demo effect when your app crashes live; mine didn*’*t, but it really should have crashed when fed with fuzzing data.*😅
