"I'm not gonna review your PR, it's written by AI🚩"

Coding assistants can generate "good" code, but the docs and READMEs...
No wonder maintainers refuse reviewing PRs adding your **ground-breaking** feature.

That’s where Humanizer comes in: a Claude Code skill that rewrites AI-generated text to remove common stylistic red flags and make it sound more natural and human.

Siqi Chen implemented this skill based on Wikipedia's guidelines for spotting AI-generated writing, targeting things like vague attributions, promotional tone and formulaic phrasing.
