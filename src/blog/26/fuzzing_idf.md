I recently published an article: "Introduction to Fuzzing ESP-IDF components"

The article provides a step-by-step guide to get started with fuzzing.

Feedback and findings are welcome! And if you identify a vulnerability in Espressif components, don’t forget to report it and claim the applicable bounty🛡️
