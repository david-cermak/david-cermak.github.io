*Fuzzing *is an essential tool for every security professional, but what about *embedded *engineers? I believe they should be *at least *aware of the techniques.

To help with that, I've created a getting-started guide tailored for firmware folks:
https://lnkd.in/guMeNKk2
It's called *OxFFFFE: F*uzzing *F*undamentals *F*or *F*irmware *E*ngineers.

This repo includes a few practical examples, ranging from a simple black-box fuzzer for a hello-world application to coverage-guided fuzzing of real-world embedded modules and protocol stacks.

*My quick recommendations:*
✅ For fast and effective results with minimal setup: Use *AFL*++
🔍 If you want to integrate with unit and property-based testing: Go for *fuzztest*
🧪 Interested in research? Try white-box fuzzing of firmware binaries

Check it out -- and let me know what you catch. 🐛
