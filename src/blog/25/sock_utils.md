Plumbing *POSIX *to hashtag#ESP32? 🛠️ Here's your toolkit.

If you've been following my posts, you know I've been porting a few libraries to ESP-IDF recently: Mosquitto, Kafka, Libssh, Libjuice and more.
They all share similar patterns, so I distilled the advanced solutions into this guide 👉https://developer.espressif.com/blog/2025/11/advanced-porting-libraries-as-components/

💡The guide is written in structured Markdown, so you can upload it to your coding assistant, reducing hours of porting work into a few prompts and tokens.

💬What library would *you *love to see running on an ESP32? (Spoiler alert: Next post is about `*avahi*`)

PS: These techniques apply not just to ESP32, but essentially any microcontroller SDK with threading and basic sockets.
