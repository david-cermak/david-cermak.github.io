*Embedded devices *in the Quantum Era ⚛️🔐

We're seeing rapid adoption of post-quantum cryptography across major platforms: Browsers, servers, SSH, TLS, ... but what about embedded systems?
How we balance security with resource constraints 👀

Next weekend at hashtag#OpenAlt 2025 in Brno, I’ll be talking about post-quantum crypto on ESP32; starting with a dedicated secure channel using *ML-KEM-*512 (a sweet spot for IoT: secure yet lightweight), and continuing toward full TLS 1.3 integration with the X25519 + ML-KEM-768 hybrid group.

The quantum era is coming, and our microcontrollers should be ready for it⚡
