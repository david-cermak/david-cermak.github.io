⚙️Fuzzing for Embedded Developers

I recently presented the fundamentals of fuzzing at hashtag#LinuxDays in Prague and turned the talk into a hands-on carousel for *firmware engineers.*
It covers the basics and includes two *simple experiments *you can run locally (just pull a Docker image).

💬I’d love to hear your feedback and what bugs you caught🐛
